# ToDo
This is application for tasks management.

There are two main objectives of this project:
 - Primary - Learning of Swift,
 - Secundary - Build of application with smart functions helping in efficient tasks planing and execution.
 
 I'm sure that my code won't be perfect so I'm open for any form of support helping me to understand my mistakes leading to improvement.
