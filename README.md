# ToDo
This is application for tasks management.

There are two main objectives of this project:
 - Primary - Learning of Swift,
 - Secundary - to build the application with smart functions helping in efficient tasks planing and execution.
 
 I'm sure that my code won't be perfect so I'm open to any form of support helping me to understand my mistakes and leading to the improvement. 

Here you have update regarding progress of development and features so far implemented:
- SwiftUI used for user interface including features like wheel/menu picker, swipe functions, etc. to ensure consisten user experience accross Apple ecosystem,
- SwiftDate used for saving data to the file.
